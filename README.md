## Introduction
Anomaly detection is a crucial aspect of data analysis that helps in identifying rare items, events, or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. This project provides a comprehensive guide and implementation for anomaly detection using Python.

## Features
- Implementation of multiple anomaly detection algorithms
- Data preprocessing and normalization techniques
- Visualization of data and detected anomalies
- Evaluation metrics for model performance
- Easy-to-follow code and documentation

## Usage
-Clone the repository:
-git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anomaly-detection.git
-Navigate to the project directory:
-cd anomaly-detection
-Open the notebook
-jupyter notebook Anamoly_Detection.ipynb
